# NightLight

The inspiration behind ‘nightlight’ stemmed from an issue that all of us have experienced; fear at night. As teenage girls, we repeatedly dread taking transportation systems, like the TTC, alone. We often come across anecdotal posts shared by other women on social media that recount their horrific experiences on public transit.

With this problem in mind, our team decided to create an application that would act as one’s “light in the night” in order to reduce the risk of harassment that females, minorities and people in general experience on public transportation.

# What It Does
In an attempt to improve physical security and to champion women, our entirely responsive web application informs the user on potential risk factors at bus stops, train and subway stations! As a user, simply…
1. Enter your starting location and destination 
2. Select a public transit route
3. View updated reports about each public transit station written by other public transit users
4. Make reports about public transit stations, as needed, and notify authorities
5. Share your location with friends and family
6. Follow the indicated route 
7. Contribute and collaborate! 
We develop a community of women empowering women, by allowing users to report any suspicious activity or incidents that they have either seen or experienced using public transport. 
E.g, harassment, sexual assault, invasion of privacy
By standing together in solidarity, public transit has never been safer! 

# Next Steps
The most notable technical implementations that we have in store for ‘nightlight’ include enabling the Google Maps API system in order to use location services, and to access a database in order to safely store the data of our users. Proper integration of S.O.S (calling 911) in order to immediately notify local authorities. Additionally, we want to make a long-lasting impact and we believe that nightlight’s concept can be feasibly applied to law enforcement. The collected reports created by the general public can be stored and then shared with local police and transit organizers to ensure better security in higher risk areas.
